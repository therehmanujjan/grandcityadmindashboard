## ⚡ Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Test in Production**
   - Deploy updated code to production server
   - Test login for all users
   - Verify API protection is working

2. **User Communication**
   - Distribute `LOGIN_CREDENTIALS.md` to all users
   - Announce password change
   - Provide support for login issues

3. **Security Configuration**
   - ⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Update `JWT_SECRET` in production `.env` file
   - Use a strong, random secret (32+ characters)
   - Never commit secrets to version control

### Optional Enhancements (Future)
1. **Password Management**
   - Add "Change Password" feature
   - Implement "Forgot Password" flow
   - Add password expiration policy

2. **Enhanced Security**
   - Implement two-factor authentication (MFA)
   - Add password complexity requirements
   - Implement token refresh mechanism
   - Add rate limiting on login endpoint

3. **Monitoring & Audit**
   - Add authentication event logging
   - Create admin dashboard for user management
   - Implement CAPTCHA after failed attempts

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [x] Server starts without errors
- [x] `/api/login` endpoint responds
- [x] Correct credentials return JWT token
- [x] Incorrect credentials rejected
- [x] All API endpoints require authentication
- [x] Token expiration works correctly
- [x] Account lockout works after 5 failed attempts
- [ ] **Manual test each user login** (recommended)
- [ ] **Test in production environment** (required)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Invalid email or password"
- Verify email format: `name@grandcity.pk`
- Check password is exactly as listed (case-sensitive)
- Ensure no extra spaces

### "Account is locked"
- Wait 30 minutes after 5 failed attempts
- Or contact admin to manually unlock

### "Access token required"
- Session expired (24 hours)
- Just log in again

### Server won't start
```bash
# Check if packages installed
npm install

# Verify database connection
node test-db-connection.js

# Check for port conflicts
netstat -ano | findstr :3000
```
