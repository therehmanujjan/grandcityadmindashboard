## ⚠️ Important Changes

### What Changed?
- ❌ **OLD:** Everyone used the same password "Grandcity123"
- ✅ **NEW:** Each user has their own unique password

### Why This Change?
- 🔒 **Better Security:** Individual passwords are more secure
- 📊 **Accountability:** We can track who does what
- 🛡️ **Protection:** If one password is compromised, others remain safe

### Login Protection
- After **5 failed login attempts**, your account will be **locked for 30 minutes**
- Your session will **automatically expire after 24 hours**
- If you see "Access token required" - just log in again
